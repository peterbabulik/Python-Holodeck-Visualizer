Hello World Example for pyMeow

This simple example demonstrates how pyMeow visualizes the most basic
Python program - printing "Hello, World!" to the console.

When loaded in pyMeow:
- The print statement becomes a green CallBlock
- You can edit the message directly in the block
- The visual representation makes it clear what the program does

This example shows how pyMeow makes Python accessible to beginners
by providing a visual, intuitive way to understand code structure.
